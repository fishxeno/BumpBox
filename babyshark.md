- To make price estimation more accurate: 
    - Require user to show settings screen and model (for phone and hardware specifically)
    - Can find serial code to find device
    - Use Google lens to detect object and assign a price
    - Simplify, just check category it is in then ask them select model
- Scam protection
    - AI detect unusual behaviour if user keeps buying and selling items
    - At a certain point users should just accept that they can be scammed buying 2nd hand stuff
- Returns feature
    - Add powerbank to let them test it
- Example products to sell
